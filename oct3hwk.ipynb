    "### Problem Introduction\n",
    "\n",
    "The goal of this project is to determine whether the vaccine by AliTech is effective at improving patient's health scores. To maximize the insight we can obtain from the available data, the bootstrapping method will be applied to allow for the estimation of the distribution of the mean health score change. Confidence intervals will also be obtainable through the application of bootstraping, hence why it is implemented here.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Hypotheses\n",
    "\n",
    "In this context, the null hypothesis states that the effect of the vaccine has no significant of the effect on patient health, meaning that the mean change in health scores is zero. However, another hypothesis states that the patient would either meaningfully increase or decrease the health scores of the patients.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Data Visualization\n",
    "\n",
    "Refer to Figure 1. Bootstrapped Means of Health Score Change, a histogram of the 10000 mean health score changes for 10000 bootstrapped samples. An overwhelming large amount of data-points are located to the right of zero, suggesting that the null hypothesis can be rejected.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Findings\n",
    "\n",
    "The program reported that `95% Confidence Interval: (0.8, 5.6)` through setting the lower and upper bound of the at the 2.5th and 97.5th percentiles and subsequently creating a 95% confidence interval. This indicates that 0 is not a plausible value for the parameter, as it is located outside of the 95% confidence area. We also find that the mean health score improvement was approximately 3.2 health points, demonstrating that the vaccine does indeed a measurable benefit to the health of the patients.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Conclusion\n",
    "The null hypothesis can be rejected, since 0 isn't a plausible value. Thus, the vaccine does in fact positively benefit the health of the patients in a measurable manner, with an estimated mean increaes of 3.2 health points. It is worth considering that the dataset provided by AliTech is fairly small, and thus the data may not be entirely generalizable. Analysis performed on a larger dataset would provide more meaningful and detailed insights."
